      <description>Like as many husbands, fathers, and curious human beings, I do have lots of interests outside my professional life. For years I&amp;rsquo;m improving my home automation environment continuously, integrating more and more entities, sensors, actors, etc. Sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m driving my family nuts with it, but it improved over time.
